        hung around with big shots Never knew love was in the sights I guess I
        missed the target Caught up in a different line of fire
        <br />
        But I know since I've been aiming For the sweetness in your soul Your
        name is on the bullet And it's gettin' ready to explode There's been a
        change inside my life And I just want to let you know
        <br />
        I've got my finger on the trigger Love is in control I've got my finger
        on the trigger I ain't lettin' go
        <br />
        Mama used to tell me Girl, you better load your gun up right She said
        ya, ya gotta come out smokin' Hit it with your best shot every time Well
        I, I didn't understand her 'Til you walked right into range I saw your
        love at twenty paces And I knew I'd won the game You better raise your
        heart up high Or love will blow you right away
        <br />
        I've got my finger on the trigger Love is in control I've got my finger
        on the trigger I ain't lettin' go I've got my finger on the trigger Love
        is in control I've got my finger on the trigger I ain't lettin' go Leave
        off that safety catch There ain't no risk We're gonna have some fun I've
        got cha, love's begun So stay with me Until the mornin' sun There's been
        a change inside My life And I just want to let you know
        <br />
        I've got my finger on the trigger Love is in control I've got my finger
        on the trigger I ain't lettin' go I've got my finger on the trigger Love
        is in control I've got my finger on the trigger I ain't lettin' go I've
        got my finger on the trigger Love is in control I've got my finger on
        the trigger I ain't lettin' go I've got my finger on the trigger Love is
        in control I've got my finger on the trigger I ain't lettin' go I've got
        my finger on the trigger Love is in control I've got my finger on the
        trigger I ain't lettin' go
